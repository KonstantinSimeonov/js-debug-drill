# Debugging drill

Each day contains a small program that needs debugging. Each program will contain at least one bug. A specification for the program will be available for each program in at least one of the following forms - `jsdoc`, `comments`, `readme` or `unit tests`.

## Usage

1. Clone or fork this repo
1. Run `npm i`
1. Create your own branch `git checkout -b fixes`
1. Fix the bugs in your branch
1. Run the tests for the respective day by using `npm test day-x/*.spec.js`. Make sure all the tests are passing.
1. (Optional) Introduce additional tests which cover even more cases!
